# OpengGL Renderer

I have always been interested in how 3d graphics are created and rendered, therefore learning OpenGL seemed like the best option. The following are the dependencies this renderer uses:  

- SDL 2.5
- GLM (math library)
- Assimp (model loader)
- stbi (texture loader)

## Current Features

- [x] first person camera
- [x] Uniform buffers
- [x] Cube map / Sky box
- [x] Forward rendering
- [x] FrameBuffer
